## Debian
1. Download the visidata tar.gz file from pypi
2. tar -xzmf visidata.tar.gz
3. cp visidata.ver.tar.gz visidata_ver.orig.tar.gz
4. cd visidata-ver/
5. Place there the contents of the debian directory from github.com/saulpw/visidata/dev/debian/

```
dch -v new_version

where new_version = "$version"-1

Edit as necessary. I usually set stability to unstable, and urgency to low, and add a small changelog.
7. Run debuild. Fix errors as they come up.
8. If a package fails to import a module, it must be added to the build dependencies as python3-modules
9. cd ..
10. If unsigned by debuild, sign the changes files
```
debsign -k keycode visidata_ver.changes
```

anjakefala has the key and password.

```
dput mentors visidata_ver.changes
